\chapter{Conclusions \& Future Work} \label{chap:concl}
Throughout our research, it became clear that AR can indeed play a valuable role in improving intelligibility of ubicomp devices. While more research is needed before we can make claims of statistical significance, we can state with confidence now that there exist AR visualizations that can very effectively support users in matching the correct lights with the correct light switches. In particular maps and colors where both popular and effective, in our larger explorative online survey as well as in our smaller more high-fidelity user tests.

\todo{Finish conclusion, discuss future work.}

%- minimap and colors are promising to improve user confidence, trust and understanding, arrows and halo's also work, but might need different scenarios to unlock their true potential, so more testing is needed

%- future work: better graphics would likely improve system effectiveness, small HoloLens FOV is also a handicap, trying out larger and more complex scenario's, other things than lights and switches, more complex interactions than pressing buttons
