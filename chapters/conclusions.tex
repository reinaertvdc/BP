\chapter{Conclusions} \label{chap:concl}
- minimap and colors are promising to improve user confidence, trust and understanding, arrows and halo's also work, but might need different scenarios to unlock their true potential, so more testing is needed

- future work: better graphics would likely improve system effectiveness, small HoloLens FOV is also a handicap, trying out larger and more complex scenario's, other things than lights and switches, more complex interactions than pressing buttons
